# Cuda Voxel Raytracing
This is a realtime voxel ray tracing prototype. I aim to make it as powerful as possible (concerning speed and quality). It should be able to render millions of voxels, maybe even of different sizes (but still layed out in an axis aligned grid). I am going to use ray tracing and nothing will be rasterized (except for UI elements). Lighting will be done not per pixel but per voxel, and independent of the rendering pipeline (similar to the lighting in Minecraft). It should be able to support direct lighting and GI.

# Milestones
* 6.1.2022: Created working project with CMake. I use C++ 17, CUDA, GLFW, GLEW and GLM. Also set up the basic engine structure and important Cuda and OpenGL stuff like a Window class and Cuda-OpenGL interoperability (displaying pixel data from Cuda in an GLFW window).
* 27.4.2022: Created basic input system (might be switched out for more capable system in the future). Implemented [J. Revelles' octree traversal algorithm](https://lsi2.ugr.es/curena/inves/wscg00/revelles-wscg00.pdf) and changed it from being recursive to iterative (2x performance).
